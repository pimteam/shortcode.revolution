<h1>Shortcode Revolution Help</h1>

<p>Shortcode Revolution is a tool that allows you to easily and reliable create various elements on your site. Dynamic elements with data, static design elements like buttons and tables, and so on.
It's techically possible to create the shortcodes manually but it's much easier to use the shortcode generator from your Shortcode Revolution menu.</p>

<h2>Post and Comments Shortcodes</h2>

<p>This section allows you to generate shortcodes that dynamically list posts or comments based on search criteria. You can use the shortcodes in widgets or in your custom theme pages.</p>

<p>The <b>posts</b> shortcode lets you search posts by IDs, categories, types, tags or phrases and display them like:</p>

<ul>	
	<li><b>Default / regular</b> - the posts will be listed with thumbnail, excerpt, publication time, etc. This design (and almost all other Shortcode Revolution templates) can be overridden as explained in the section "Overriding Shortcode Revolution Templates" at the end of this guide.</li>
	<li><b>List</b> is a short unordered list with the post titles and links.</li>
	<li><b>Carousel</b> creates a slider / carousel from the posts that respond to your criteria. We use our own custom slider code - no bloated ready sliders, so it's very light and simple.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <b>related posts</b> shortcode finds and displays which are related to the current or selected post. You can give relation criteria like matching tags and/or categories. The display formats are the same as with the posts shortcode. This excellent shortcode can be added at the bottom of your single post template to always display related content without using yet another plugin.</p>

<p>The <b>comments</b> shortcode displays comments related to a post or just most recent / best comments. The display formats are default and carousel / slider.</p>
